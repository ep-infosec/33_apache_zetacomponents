 * Common interface for all context readers.

 * This interface specifies the methods that a backend should implement if it
 * wants to act as a general purpose translation context reader. It extends on
 * the built-in Iterator interface.
 *
 * Example (see {@link ezcTranslationTsBackend} for a more elaborate example):
 * <code>
 * <?php
 *     $r = new ezcTranslationTsBackend( 'usr/share/translations' );
 *     $r->setOptions( array( 'format' => 'translation-[LOCALE].xml' ) );
 *     $r->initReader( 'nl_NL' );
 *     $r->next();
 *     while ( $r->valid() )
 *     {
 *         $ctxt = $r->current();
 *         $r->next();
 *     }
 *     $r->deinitReader();
 * ?>
