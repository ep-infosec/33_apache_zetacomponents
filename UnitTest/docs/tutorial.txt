eZ Components - UnitTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No release
==========

UnitTest is an internal component which extends PhpUnit to facilitate test
running and reports of the components themselves.

For this reason, there is no tutorial for this component. If you really want
to use it for some reason it's sane to expect some community support on IRC or
the mailing list.
